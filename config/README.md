Setting up an Administrator account
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once your server is up, you probably want to make yourself an Administrator (~) on it.

### config/usergroups.csv

To become an Administrator, create a file named `config/usergroups.csv` containing

    USER,~

Replace `USER` with the username that you would like to become an Administrator. Do not put a space between the comma and the tilde.

This username must be registered. If you do not have a registered account, you can create one using the Register button in the settings menu (it looks like a gear) in the upper-right of Pok√©mon Showdown.

Once you're an administrator, you can promote/demote others easily with the `/admin`, `/leader`, `/mod`, etc commands.

Setting The Server
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Copy `config/config-example.js` into `config/config.js`, and edit as you please.
