=========

The purpose of this mod is to get rid of luck on competitive Pokémon while modding the game as least as possible. To achieve this, all luck effects that can affect the outcome of a match have been minimified or nullified.

*The main luck element of the game, critical hit, is gone. Moves, items, and abilities are updated to reflect that change.
*Accuracy checks are removed. Moves, items, and abilities are updated to reflect that change.
*Evasion is changed for defense on both stats.
*Accuracy boosts are changed for boosts on both attacking stats.
*Paralyse no longer makes you skip turns.
*Freeze is now thawed if the Pokémon is contact with any hot move (like scald), or any Fire-, Rock-, Fighting-, Normal-, Ground-type attacks. Otherwise it ends after four turns.
*Sleep always lasts two turns.
*Speed ties are (almost) done for: in case of equal speed, the Pokémon with more HP will move faster, then the Pokémon with less weight, then the shorter one. In case of total tie, the Pokémon with less teammates, then the Pokémon whose overall team speed is greater, then, in case of exactly equal teams, we accept that a coin flip will decide who moves first.
*Secondaries are now assured. Each time you use a move with a secondary, you gain a volatile (just like Stockpile). This volatile will produce this secondary effect upon reaching 100% cap. This will vary between moves.
*Confusion is no longer something hateable. Now it halves the damage you do and applies it to yourself as well as the target. Only works if you damage a target that is not yourself.
*Infatuation halves your speed.
*Flinch still works as it works currently, but with the new secondary move mechanics. Fake out still works as right now.
*Damage is no longer random. Random element of the damage formula has been scrapped.
*OHKO moves are now 90 base power moves that ignore defense modifiers. If you use Lock-On or Mind Reader before using them, their base power is doubled.
*All multihit moves become three-hit moves. Their Base Power is updated accordingly.
*All partial trapping and trapping moves are 5 turns now.
*Protect gives a % damage reduction as opposed to its official functionality.
